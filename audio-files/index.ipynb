    "There are a lot of digital audio formats available, but each one of them falls\n",
    "into one of two categories: either it's a lossless or a lossy format.  Files in\n",
    "lossy formats (e.g. Ogg-Vorbis, MP3) are normally much smaller because\n",
    "information which is contained in the original signal but is (ideally) not\n",
    "audible is thrown away. When using a lossless format, the original signal can be\n",
    "perfectly restored, either because no compression is used at all (e.g. WAV) or\n",
    "the compression doesn't loose information (e.g. FLAC).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to distibute your latest song on the internet you might want to use\n",
    "a lossy format to save some bandwidth, if you plan to further process your data\n",
    "(or if you are aiming at a high-end crowd) you should choose a lossless format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest common denominator for exchanging audio files is probably the MS WAV\n",
    "format. But although it is widely supported, only few programs support all\n",
    "variants of this format. WAV files support both fixed point and floating point\n",
    "numbers. Very popular are 16-bit fixed point (PCM) values, as this is the format\n",
    "of Audio CDs.\n",
    "Some professional recordings use 24-bit PCM data. 32-bit PCM data is also\n",
    "possible, but this is practically never used.\n",
    "\n",
    "32-bit floating-point data, however, are widely used by digital audio\n",
    "workstations (DAWs), so you may encounter those.\n",
    "As most audio processing applications use 32-bit floating-point data internally,\n",
    "this is also a meaningful data type for file exchange between applications."
