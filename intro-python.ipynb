    "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose programming language.\n",
    "It is an *interpreted* language, i.e. source code is not compiled into an executable file but it is directly executed by an *interpreter*.\n",
    "A file containing Python code can be executed like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python my_code.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can also act as an interactive interpreter where you can type and run Python code line-by-line.\n",

    "\n",
    "You have the full power of Python in there, but it is not very convenient.\n",
    "A much better alternative is [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) (formerly known as [IPython](http://ipython.org/)), which is described on a [separate page](intro-jupyter.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, this very page you're just reading is a so-called [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/) (formerly known as [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)), which means that you can view it either as a [static web page](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/mgeier/python-audio/master/intro-python.ipynb) or, if you have IPython installed locally, you can also open the [notebook file](http://raw.github.com/mgeier/python-audio/master/intro-python.ipynb) with Jupyter/IPython and run the code in it interactively. You can also change stuff and play around with it.\n",

    "\n",
