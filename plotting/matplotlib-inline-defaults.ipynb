    "Long story short, you should add some things to your IPython configuration file.\n",
    "Typically, this file is located at `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_kernel_config.py`.\n",
    "In case of doubt, you can find your profile directory with this command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    python3 -m IPython profile locate\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to share the settings with your collaborators,\n",
    "you can also create a file named `ipython_kernel_config.py`\n",

    "If you are using Git to manage your files,\n",
    "don't forget to commit this local configuration file to your repository.\n",
    "Different directories can have different local configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, plots look best when using the SVG format.\n",
    "To enable SVG plots, use this in your IPython configuration:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "c.InlineBackend.figure_formats = {'svg', 'pdf'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to keep using the default PNG plots,\n",
    "or if you want to use double resolution HiDPI (a.k.a. `'png2x'`, a.k.a. `'retina'`) plots,\n",
    "you should still change the default DPI (= \"dots per inch\") setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c.InlineBackend.rc = {'figure.dpi': 96}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The default value of 72 DPI is only appropriate for\n",
    "the [Qt Console](https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "With a setting of 96 DPI, the PNG plots will have about the same size\n",
    "as the SVG and PDF plots.\n",
    "Also, when properly converted to LaTeX/PDF and printed on paper,\n",
    "the figure size in inch will correspond to the actual size of the plot.\n",

    "Whenever you re-execute your notebooks, the SVG plots will be re-generated\n",
    "with new, seemingly random IDs.\n",
    "This can be very annoying because the SVG content changes even if the plot itself doesn't change.\n",
    "Luckily, since\n",
    "[Matplotlib 2.0.0](https://matplotlib.org/users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_2.0.0.html#added-svg-hashsalt-key-to-rcparams)\n",
